    <h1>Connection check to the Midi Input Provider native application failed!</h1>
    <p>
      The Midi Input Provider Addon requires the help of a native application to be able to access your Midi devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      The required application for the Linux platform is part of the original project and can be downloaded from here: <a href="https://github.com/M-Reimer/midiinputprovider/tree/master/nativeapp">Native application download and install instructions</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      So far there is no support for other operating systems as this would require someone else to develop the required native applications.
